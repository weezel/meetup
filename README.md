# Golang meetups Tampere

I'm co-organizing the Golang meetup in Tampere and occasionally give presentations.
This repo contains snippets and broader examples shared during the live lectures.

The very first Golang Tampere meetup (ever?) was held on 2025-01-15 at Framery.
I gave a presentation `Go 102 & design patterns` which is available
[cmd/150125/presentation/go102_and_design_patterns.pdf](cmd/150125/presentation/go102_and_design_patterns.pdf).
